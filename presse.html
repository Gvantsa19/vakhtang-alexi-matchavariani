            Amsterdam.
            Before the Festival Ouverture, the 2 nd piano concerto and the 10-th Sypmphony were played, conductor
            Vakhtang Matchavariani from Georgia payed tribute to his father, composer Alexi Matchavariani. This artist
            was a contemporary of Shostakovich.
            He also experienced the decline of the Soviet Regime and subsequently the artistic turnaround. That's why it
            is not surprising that two parts of the Suite " The Knight in the Panterskin " had a striking resemblance
            with for example Shostakovich 5-th Symphony.
            Father Matchavariani had started experimenting with more atonal malodylines.
            With the American pianist Ana-Maria Vera it luckily is progression.Vera is known a beautiful young lady who
            with calm assurance gives way to her musical vision.
            The tenacity and power that the conductor Vakhtang Matchavariani showed in the 10-th Symphony of
            Shostakovich was an example of how this orchestra has a characteristic way of playing with which it in any
            case got a lot of acclaim with the Amsterdam public.

            On 30 October internationally famous Georgian conductor Vakhtang Machavariani gave a concert of the work of
            Mussorgsky,Prokofiev and his father Aleksi Machavariani at Tbilisi Music Centre.
            ..............................
            It was a risk devoting the second half of the programme to Aleksi Machavariani's music for the ballet "The
            Taming of the Shrew",particulary as it was the world premiere of this piece. It is a substantial
            work,certainly not incidental music,and in a way it was unfortunate that this was the premiere,as it will
            repay considerable future study.

            It grabs the audience from the first however,and in an unusual way.The first bars declare "Watch out,watch
            out,there's a shrew about",and you never know how seriously to take what is being said throughout. It is
            very difficult to maintain such a tone for any length of time without being misunderstood,but this music and

          <li class="wrappe-li">38.) HATS OFF GENTLEMEN.

            On 30 October internationally famous Georgian conductor Vakhtang Machavariani gave a concert of the work of
            Mussorgsky,Prokofiev and his father Aleksi Machavariani at Tbilisi Music Centre.

            The evening began with Mussorgsky's famous tone poem "Night on a Bare Mountain"....... In this rendering
            this was finely controlled,tonal appropriateness appearing to be one of Vakhtang Machavariani's
            characteristics as a conductor.Another is that he seems to be interested in what the composer actualy
            meant,rather than what other people are supposed to infer from it,something always particulary noticeable in
            the way people render Russian music.Many Western conductors except their orchestras to drown Rusiian music
            in tortuous sweeps and groans,as if written by a loquacious drunk going berserk in a bar. This completely
            misses the subcutaneous fatalism at the heart of all Russian music, extracted simply by playing the notes.To
            this extend Night on a Bare Mountain does not sound very Russian,but Vakhtang Machavariani and his highly
            proficient orchestra were able to convey the fact that it is not only universal but very much a piece of
            1886,when Russian aristocrats were busy showing how modern they were by developing an iterest in spirits and
            ghoulies inherent in many Western countries long before.

            The second piece was Prokofiev's 3 rd Piano Concerto.....

            Matchavariani the man with the answers.
            Georgian music lovers commemorated the 95th birthday of famous Georgian composer Alexi Matchavariani at a
            concert held at Tbilisi musical centre on November 14. The Georgia National Symphony Orchestra was conducted
            by Vakhtang Matchavariani, his son, a conductor widely experienced and respected in Europe.

            The concert began with Matchavariani's Third Symphonic Suit from the ballet Othello. This was first
            performed in 1957 at the Tbilisi State Opera, and swiftly achieved international recognition, being staged
            in many cities worldwide. On the basis of the music alone, you can see why. Matchavariani's music turns this
            on its head, by combining this with a warm lyricism and deep devotion to music itself which puts this
            intellectualism into context. Yes, that part of life exists, but we all have a fundamental humanity,
            expressed through soaring violin lines, superb orchestration and organic harmony and counterpoint.

            People did seem to be a bit taller after hearing this music, and seeing how Vakhtang Matchavariani instilled
            the sense of the importance of this work, that it had a universality beyond 'interpretation'.

            The second half of the concert was the premiere of symphonic suite The Taming of the Shrew. This was a
            thoroughly enjoyable romp, Shakespeare's Shrew reappearing in a motif when least expected, emotion suddenly
            leavened by playfulness, argument dissolving into the drama that had created it. This is was what
            Shakespeare would have composed himself, as Matchavariani clearly had the same connection with truth that
            Shakespeare had, and knew exactly what to do about it.

            The audience was deeply appreciative of both music and performance, as any audience would have been.
            Matchavariani thoroughly deserves a more prominent place in the classical canon.

            ..............................

            It was a risk devoting the second half of the programme to Aleksi Machavariani's music for the ballet "The
            Taming of the Shrew",particulary as it was the world premiere of this piece. It is a substantial
            work,certainly not incidental music,and in a way it was unfortunate that this was the premiere,as it will
            repay considerable future study.

            It grabs the audience from the first however,and in an unusual way.The first bars declare "Watch out,watch
            out,there's a shrew about",and you never know how seriously to take what is being said throughout. It is
            very difficult to maintain such a tone for any length of time without being misunderstood,but this music and

            TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

            An audition was arranged, where Mr. Matchawariani conducted the “Freischütz” – Ouverture with the Vienna
            Philharmonic Orchestra. From what I could assertain in the very short time given Mr. Matchawariani, he seems
            to have a conducting gift and he showed solid musicianship. He is certainly worthy of any support and help
            in his affort to develop his career.

            I have followed Mr. Matchavariani’s career with interest for some time now and must say that he is a most
            remarkable, unique musician and artistic personality. His skills have produced some extraordinary concert
            and recording experiences.

            Dear Vakhtang,
            Your orchestra played the difficult Mahler 7th Symphony magnificently with a love, passion and commitment
            one rarely sees. Surely this is a reflection and tribute to your leadership and to the depth of your musical
            influence as maestro. You have managed to mold a special music making tradition in Georgia.
