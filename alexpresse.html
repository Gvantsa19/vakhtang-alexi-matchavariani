          <li class="wrappe-li">3.)    A.

            Sir Yehudi Menuhin. London. 20-06-1985.</li>

            Maya Plisetskaia. 25-03-1958. “Komunist”.</li>
            <li class="wrappe-li">6.)    “Othello” is one of the greatest choreographycal – Symphonic creations. It is one of the most remarkable events of the modern musical creations.

Seine Klavier – und Violinkonzerte werden in vielen Laendern der Erde aufgefuehrt. Eine vorzuegliche Interpretin seiner Klavierstuecke ist die deutsche Pianistin Annerose Schmidt, Preistraeger des Schumann – und des Chopin – Wettbewerbs. Das Orchester der Berliner Philharmonie unter Leitung von Franz Konwitschny begleitete mehrfach sowjetische und auslaendische Interpreten Matchavarianis.

                      <li class="wrappe-li">11.)    IL M Maciavariani si e voluto reincarnare spiritualmente nel dramma di “Otello” dando a questo personaggio e novita di incisivo interesse – un temperamento dolce ed aggressivo nello stesso tempo; il risultato di questa sintesi nella composizione musicale ha fatto nascere cosi'una delle piu belle pagine liriche di questo balletto. Maciavariani in “Otello” non vende l'africano arso dalla gelosia od influenzato dall animo diabolico di Jago per indurlo sino al delitto; il Maestro, pur senza alterare la figura del protagonista, transforma Otello in un eroe che innanzitutto e prima di tutto ama Desdemona di un amore puro e sincero; …Maciavariani riesce compositore altamente espressiro, perché egli segne ogni personaggio della trama shakespeariana, con la sua chiara luce che risalta in modo stupendo ed indimenticabille in questo maraviglioso balletto.

The Georgia National Symphony Orchestra was conducted by Vakhtang Matchavariani, his son, a conductor widely experienced and respected in Europe.

This was first performed in 1957 at the Tbilisi State Opera, and swiftly achieved international recognition, being staged in many cities worldwide. On the basis of the music alone, you can see why. Matchavariani’s music turns this on its head, by combining this with a warm lyricism and deep devotion to music itself which puts this intellectualism into context. Yes, that part of life exists, but we all have a fundamental humanity, expressed through soaring violin lines, superb orchestration and organic harmony and counterpoint.

This was a thoroughly enjoyable romp, Shakespeare’s Shrew reappearing in a motif when least expected, emotion suddenly leavened by playfulness, argument dissolving into the drama that had created it. This is was what Shakespeare would have composed himself, as Matchavariani clearly had the same connection with truth that Shakespeare had, and knew exactly what to do about it.

  ..............................
  
  It was a risk devoting the second half of the programme to Aleksi Machavariani's music for the ballet "The Taming of the Shrew",particulary as it was the world premiere of this piece. It is a substantial work,certainly not incidental music,and in a way it was unfortunate that this was the premiere,as it will repay considerable future study.
  
  It grabs the audience from the first however,and in an unusual way.The first bars declare "Watch out,watch out,there's a shrew about",and you never know how seriously to take what is being said throughout. It is very difficult to maintain such a tone for any length of time without being misunderstood,but this music and this performance pulled this off,in an excellent rendering of the light comedy of Shakespeare's play.Within a short while you know that this is going to be the highlight of the show.The orchestration is flawless and very satisfying for the performers,who each have a considerable part and plenty to say, the music darting around from one section to another like a gymnast flinging himself about on the rings.The deeply suggestive tempo,the musical equivalent of rapidly raising eyebrows,is maintained even in the more solemn parts,when the consequences of all the jollity are reflected on,but nothing gets in the way of the fundamental triumph of fun when the shrew is tamed,but into a wiser shrew,at the end.
  
  Like all bloodthirsty reviewers you wait for the misplaced effect,mistiming,failure of expres- sion,wrong choice or misplaced note in this piece.In this music,and this performance of it, this reviewer waited in vain.The piece is brilliant,like the way it was played,but it has far greater substance than a work which has brilliance alone.When you write reviews people tell you not to be too positive or negative because people will think it is a put up job.If this newspaper wants to sack me for telling the truth,let it. If Russia wants to start another war and Georgia can choose its weapon,it should choose the music of Aleksi Machavariani.

                                                                                    He received the usual collection of grandiloquently titled Soviet awards, including the People's Artist of the USSR and the USSR State Prize. Perhaps most significantly, he was one of the lesser composers along with Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Khachaturian to be accused of "formalism" in 1948.....
                                                                                    He wrote seven symphonies, concertos for piano, cello and violin, of course, , as well as ballet scores, and much chamber music. Some of this was recorded by Melodiya in the LP era (in some instances such as this one, conducted by his son Vakhtang), and this is where the current recording comes from.There are other recordings also available in the same way, including three of the symphonies, the ballet "Othello" and two string quartets.....
                                                                                    Yehudi Menuhin is quoted as describing the concerto as "beautiful - it contains all the passion, the poetry and deep spirituality ... added to the lyrical quality of the music there is a robust intellectual approach - all in all, a most memorable piece which any violinist would have great pleasure in interpreting". It was performed by David Oistrakh in the 1950s and was recorded outside the USSR on the Columbia label, though I cannot find who the soloist was.

In fact, you might imagine it to be the violin concerto that Rachmaninov never wrote. It is cast in the traditional Romantic three-movement format of Brahms and Tchaikovsky: the first, the longest, where the composer shows his skill in developing themes, the second, a gorgeous adagio, and the finale, a virtuoso crowd pleaser. .....
                                                                                    The first movement (I can find no tempo indications) features development of two very contrasting themes: the first, pulsating and vibrant and the second, meltingly lyrical. The slow movement has a more important role for the orchestra.The third movement has elements in the orchestra reminiscent of Shostakovich's first piano concerto, but is dominated by the violin fireworks, which it is easy to imagine may be based on Georgian folk music.....
                                                                                    This concerto is not going to supplant the Tchaikovsky in your affections, but it is at least as good, and in my opinion better, than the Khachaturian with which it is roughly contemporary. Surely Naxos, as it delves further into the obscure, could put this on its "to do" list. .....
                                                                                    Marvellously entertaining, stirringly romantic and totally deserving of a new recording.

  When I was 17 (1981), I heard Alexi Matchavariani's violin concerto for the first time. With a tonality that reminded me of Schoenberg’s early work, it is a wonderful piece that makes use of delicate orchestration.
  Most of all, I was moved by the wonder of the motifs. In the middle stage of the first movement, the violin solo ends, and a variation of the second theme is played by the entire orchestra. This is the signature part of this piece. This music does not only express the harsh nature of the Caucasus but that of all the mountain regions of West Asia. But when one considers the musical scale of this melody, it truly has a more Georgian feeling. In his music, lives, joy, and sadness of the people of Georgia has been finely expressed.

Ich kenne jetzt schon mehrere Ihrer Kompositionen und ich verehre Sie als einen ganz GroBen unter den lebenden Komponisten. Ihr Name sollte auch in Mitteleuropa, ja in der ganzen Welt an Bedeutung gewinnen und was ich dazu beitragen kann, will ich von Herzen gerne tun.

                                                                                    46.)   "Cut the crap and get the juice" Alexi Machavariani's opera Medea, July 5.
                                                                                    The only thing you can predict about the music of Alexi Machavariani is that it will be of the highest quality.
                                                                                    Those familiar with his monumental orchestral works would expect a Matchavariani opera to be a very involved and grand affair.
                                                                                    Instead, in Medea, he presents one you could performe in any living room............
                                                                                    ......The Georgian libretto, written largely by conductor Vakhtang Machavariani who is giving so much to the world by binging his father's music to a wider audience, was incomprehensible for the non-Georgian, despite the helpful summary in the programme.
                                                                                    As with all good operas however this hardly mattered...............
                                                                                    ......You imagine Alexi Machavariani played every instrument under the sun and sang well too, such is his empathy for each part:............
                                                                                    ......Perheps this opera should be compared not with other operas but Milton's brief epic Paradise Regained. Read it on its own terms, it is a masterpiece. Start comparing it with what you think it should be, you get lost. Just as with Georgia and its people in fact.
                                                                                    It's no crime coming from an English speaking country, but as Machavariani senior and junior show, cultural background is no exuse for ignorance.
