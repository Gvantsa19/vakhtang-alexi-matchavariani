The some time together with D. Shostakovich and S. Prokofiev he was accused in “formalism”. After Stalin’s death, the situation has started to change.
    The new dimension and sensational success had A. Matchavariani after writing his famous violin concerto in 1949, which was performed in many countries. First performers were M. Weiman ( Leningrad ) and D. Oistrach ( Moscow ). The concerto was recorded a number of times by ”Melodia”, as well by “Columbia Records” in USA .

        In 1977 A. Matchavariani wrote probably the most important composition for him. It is ballet “The Knight in the tiger skin”, the poem of the 12-th century of the greatest Georgian poet and philosopher S. Rustaveli, pride of Georgia . It’s first production was in Leningrad , at “Kirov”(Mariisky) theatre, choreographer O. Vinogradov.

In 1983 Matchavariani has finished №3 and №4 symphonies. №3 Symphony is a composition of a huge power, deep and tender. The critic wrote about it: It is universal and human, cosmic and earthy. №4 symphony “The Youth’s” for strings, percussion, piano, celesta and harp is a sparkling, melodic, lyrical, motor composition with electric dynamism.
        After writing the ballet in two acts “The Taming of the shrew” after W. Shakespeare in 1984, he continues the line of the symphony №3 and in 1986 he writes a stunning №5 symphony “Ushba”. 46 minute symphony in two parts (without interval) is a huge universal power, like a philosophical treaty.
